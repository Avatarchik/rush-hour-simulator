## Gameplay

The user has the role of the SBB manager. They have an initial budget which accounts as their score. The more money they have, the better. ([Money makes the world go round](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVZw3MK50Rk))

The user is presented with two options, buy rails and install them to connect two stations or buy train carriages. By connecting more stations, they can earn more money and have more passengers satisfied. If they don't, they lose money.
